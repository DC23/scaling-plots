# scaling-plots
Automated strong and weak scaling plots from tabular timing results.
This is not the best or only way to do this, but it suits my needs.
Many aspects of the plots can be controlled through the commmand line arguments.
See the examples, or just look at the code and help text.

## To Do

* Scripts that generate the results spreadsheet by parsing the batch system (eg:
  SLURM, PBS) outputs.
